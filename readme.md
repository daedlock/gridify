## Dependencies
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [VelocityJS](http://julian.com/research/velocity/)
          
      
      
## Installation

###Bower

```
bower install gridify --save
```

Just make sure that _jquery_ and _velocity.js_ is included before gridify because it depends on them.


 

###Manually

Download the [production version][min] or the [development version][max]. and make sure to grab the latest velocityjs from [here](http://julian.com/research/velocity/)

[min]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daedlock/jquery-gridify/master/dist/jquery.gridify.min.js
[max]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daedlock/jquery-gridify/master/dist/jquery.gridify.js
 
In your web page:

```html
<script src="/path/to/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="/path/to/velocity.js"></script>
<script src="/path/to/jquery.gridify.min.js"></script>
```


## Usage
__HTML__:

```
<div class="yourSelector">
	<div class="page">
		...
	</div>
	<div class="page">
		...
	</div>
	<div class="page">
		...
	</div>
</div>
```

**Javascript**:

```
var grid = new $.Gridify($(".yourSelector"));
```

or

```
var grid = new $.Gridify($(".grid-pages"),{
	//options
});

```

this will initialize the page grid with the default behavior, you can extend the default behavior and extend the functionality by taking advantage of the `moveTo(i,j)` method. It normally gives you a way to manually move to the page at the given index (i,j).

```
grid.moveTo(0,1) //will move to the element at row 0 and column 1

```
      
        
          
          
## Options


| key  | type | default  | description  |
|---|---|---|---|
| pageSelector | string |  .page |  the page CSS Selector |
| pagesPerRow  | integer | 3  | number of pages per row. In otherwords, the threshold before inserting a new row into the grid  |
| arrowKeysEnabled | boolean  | true  | Enable navigating between grid pages using keyboard arrows  |
| onAfterPageSlide | function | `function(i,j){}`  | Fires after navigating to a page. The i,j represents the current page position in 2D space  |
| onBeforePageSlide  | function | `function(i,j){}`   | Fires before navigating to a page The i,j represents the current page position in 2D space  |
